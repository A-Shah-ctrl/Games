#  Python-based Games

This repository is a collection of Python-based games I created as (1) side projects (2) as a part of programming courses (3) as a part of hackathons. Each game is self-contained and includes its own requirements.

## 🎮Games Included

### 🧠 Unbeatable Tic Tac Toe
This is a Python-based Tic Tac Toe game featuring two modes:
- **One Player Mode**: Play against an unbeatable AI
- **Two Player Mode**: Play locally with a friend

The AI opponent was implemented using the minimax algorithm as part of course work for **CS50** (HarvardX), and later extended to include a UI and multiplayer option.<br>

### ⚛️ Quantum Tic Tac Toe
This is a Python-based Quantum Tic Tac Toe game. A twist on the classic game using quantum mechanics-inspired rules. It has a two-player mode only.

This game was developed in collaboration with two other students as part of the PyJaC hackathon hosted at the University of Toronto Mississauga.
