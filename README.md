#  Python-based Games
‚ÄºÔ∏èUpdate in progress <br>
This repository is a collection of Python-based games I created in undergrad as (1) side projects (2) as a part of programming courses (3) as a part of hackathons. Each game is self-contained and includes its own requirements.

## Games Included

### Unbeatable Tic Tac Toe
This is a Python-based Tic Tac Toe game featuring two modes:
- **One Player Mode**: Play against an unbeatable AI
- **Two Player Mode**: Play locally with a friend

The AI opponent was implemented using the minimax algorithm as part of course work for **CS50** (HarvardX), and later extended to include a UI and multiplayer option.<br>
